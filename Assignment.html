	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
		<td>A HTML tag is like a container for either content or other HTML tags.A HTML element consists of the start tag + content tag + end tag. Some HTML tags do not have end tags like < img > hence in those cases HTML element will consist of start tag + content.

	<tr>
		<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
		<td>HTML Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An example of a tag is: < h1 >.Most tags must be opened < h1 >  and closed < /h1 > in order to function.Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>There is a special group of elements that only have start tags and does not contain any content within it, these elements are called void elements. Void elements doesn’t have ending tags and can only have attributes but do not contain any kind of content. These elements can have backslash before ending of start tag but that is completely optional. Example of such elements are <b> < br >,< hr >,< img >,< input >,< link >,< base >,< meta >,< area >,< embed >,< col >,< track >,< source >etc.</b>

	<td><b>What are different types of lists in HTML?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>HTML lists allow the content to follow a proper semantic structure.All the tags in the list require opening and closing tags.There are 3 types of lists in HTML, namely:
		<dt><dd>
	<b>1)Unordered List<br>  
	2)Ordered List<br>  
	3)Description List<br></b>
	

<b>1)Unordered List:</b> An Unordered list is used to create a list of related items, in bulleted or unordered format. It starts with the < ul > tag,followed by the < li >tag to show list items inside < ul > tag.<br>

<b>2)Ordered Lists:</b> The Ordered lists have an order which is either numerical or alphabetical.The < ol > tag is used to create ordered lists in HTML and just like unordered list, we use < li > tag to define or show lists inside < ol > tag.<br>

<b>3)Description List:</b> A description list is a type of list where each item has a description. It is also known as a definition list. The < dl > tag is used to create description list, the < dt > tag defines the item, and the < dd > tag describes each item in list<br>
Example:-<a href="Que05.html">Click here</a>

</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>The class attribute is often used to point to a class name in a style sheet. It can also be used by a JavaScript to access and manipulate elements with the specific class name. In the following example we have three < div > elements with a class attribute with the value of "city". All of the three < div > elements will be styled equally according to the .city style definition in the head section.<br>
		Example:-<a href="Que06.html">Click here</a>

	<td>Difference between id and class attribute: The only difference between them is that “id” is unique in a page and can only apply to at most one element, while “class” selector can apply to multiple elements.<br>
		Example:-<a href="Que07.html">click here</a>

		< b >-----Defines bold text<br>
		< i >-----Defines a part of text is typically displayed in italic.<br>

	<td><b>How is Cell Padding different from Cell Spacing?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>Cellpadding basically defines the space present between a table cell’s border and the content present in it.
And Cellspacing basically defines the space present between individual adjacent cells.Both Cellspacing and Cellpadding are the attributes that one can use in table formatting. They basically set those whitespaces in any given table cell. Thus, they form a significant part of a web document. Although both of them are attributes, there is a major difference between Cellpadding and Cellspacing in their functionality. We majorly use the Cellpadding for fixing the width present between a cell edge and the content that it contains. Conversely, we use Cellspacing for setting spaces between individual cells.
Example:-
<a href="Que09.html">Click here</a>

	<td><b>: How can we club two or more rows or columns into a single row or column in an HTML table?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>It can be done by using the rowspan and colspan attribute in HTML.The rowspan is used to merge or combine the number of cells in a row whereas the colspan is used to merge column cells in a table. 
		Example:-<a href="Que10.html">Click here</a>

	<td><b>Que.11</b></td>
	<td><b>What is the difference between a block-level element and an inline element?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
<td>There are quite a few differences actually. Here are the most important ones:
<b>1)Block Elements:</b><br>
•	Always expand to fit the width of their container, but will only expand vertically to accomodate their content (an empty block element will be the width of its container, but have a height of 0).<br>
•	Force newlines before and after.<br>
•	Accept width, height, margins, padding, and border.<br>

Examples:< p >,< div >,< li ><br>
<b>2)Inline Elements:<br></b>
•	Wrap tightly around their content both horizontally and vertically.<br>
•	Flow like text (do not create line breaks).<br>
•	Accept left and right margins, but not top or bottom.<br>
•	Accept any border or padding.<br>
•	Ignore set widths and heights.

Examples:< a >,< span ><br>
Example:-<a href="Que11.html">Click here</a>

	<td><b>How to create a Hyperlink in HTML?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>HTML links are hyperlinks. The HTML < a > tag defines a hyperlink. The most important attribute of the < a > element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination. It has the following syntax: < a href="url">link text< /a ><br>

		Example:-<a href="Que12.html">Click here</a></td>

	<td><b>What is the use of an iframe tag?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>The iframe tag in HTML creates an inline rectangular frame that allows another HTML document to be embedded inside the current one. In addition, it allows several attributes inside the tag. These attributes control properties such as the webpage to display, height, and width of the frame, allowing scrolling, borders, and margins.<br>
		Example:-<a href="Que13.html">Cick here</a>

<tr>
	<td><b>Que.14</b></td>
	<td><b>What is the use of a span tag? Explain with example?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>The HTML span element is a generic inline container for inline elements and content. It is used to group elements for styling purposes (by using the class or id attributes), A better way to use it when no other semantic element is available.
The span tag is a paired tag means it has both open(<) and closing (>) tags, and it is mandatory to close the tag. The span tag is used for the grouping of inline elements & this tag does not make any visual change by itself. span is very similar to the div tag, but div is a block-level tag and span is an inline tag.<br>
	Example:-<a href="Que14.html">Click here</a>

The syntax looks like this: < img src="URL" alt="descriptive text" >

	<td><b>Que.17</b></td>
	<td><b>What are the different tags to separate sections of text?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td>There are three tags that can be used to separate the texts:<br>
•	< br > tag – Usually < br > tag is used to separate the line of text. It breaks the current line and conveys the flow to the next line.<br>
•	< p > tag – This contains the text in the form of a new paragraph.<br>
•	< blockquote > tag – It is used to define a large quoted section.

	<td><b>What are logical and physical tags in HTML?</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td valign="top"><b>Ans.</b></td>
	<td><b>Physical tags:</b> Physical tags are used to indicate that how specific characters are to be formatted or indicated using HTML tags. Any physical style tag may contain any item allowed in text, including conventional text, images, line breaks, etc. Physical tags can only be used for styling purposes for specific elements. Although each physical tag has a defined style, you can override that style by defining your own look for each tag. All physical tags require ending tags.<br>
	
	<b>Logical Tags:</b> Logical tags are used to tell the browser what kind of text is written inside the tags. Logical tags are also known as Structural tags because they specify the structure of the document. Logical tags are used to indicate to the visually impaired person that there is something more important in the text or to emphasize the text ie, logical tags can be used for styling purposes as well as to give special importance to text content.
